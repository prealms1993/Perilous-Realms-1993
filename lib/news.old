The CONSENT command can now be set to consent to anyone you can see in the
game, regardless of if they're in the same room as you or not.  As long as
neither or you leaves the game all the way, consent will remain (or unless
you select another consentee or clear your consent).  It would be a good idea
to do this if you're grouped.

The MOTD command will allow you to view the message of the day again, if you
missed it upon logging in.  Remember to read it, it contains often important
information.

NO robots or multiple characters are allowed! Violaters will be warned (maybe)
then deleted the next time!

Portal is now pc to pc only.. this is due to some new areas and sectors going
in.. and the fact that we want you to explore more.

ANYONE can wear ANYTHING until we get the anti-class stuff fixed. But dont
be shocked when you cant later!
(^^This should really be true now^^)

Components are in testing for the mage class. You can for now buy all except 3
components in midgard at Osfols or in Tagol (at a much cheaper price).

You DO NOT need components to cast spells BUT the cost is more if you dont have
them. Mana cost will be Diff * mana (diff is gotten from prac) with diff a min
of 2 even if its 1.

Kills lists are now cleared if you die.

Stuff in bags stack now.

IMMORTALS ARE *NOT* ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR MORTAL AND IMMORTL ON AT THE SAME TIME
(violaters to be severely thrashed and deleted!)

A Note on illusionists. They are not yet read and when they are they will not
be anything like they were before. There will be mostly all new spells for them
and they will be real room affecting illusion type spells (such as wall of ??
phantasmal force, cloud kill etc). There will also NOT be an il/th class ever.
I'm not sure on a time line here as school comes first and midterms are here.

Components now have a # of uses (seen when you look in a pouch or do inventory)
and thus some cost more now.

Some components have been added Mages and Cleris require 1 item for almost all
spells above level 50. See osfol for this item.

up writing on the board instead! :)

Consider - Has been totaly rewritten the old version sucked plain and simple
	   all it did was compare levels. It now compares AC, absorb, HP, DMG 
	   and thac0 factors then trys to guess how long it would take each of
	   you to win. It *DOES NOT* consider spec procs such as breathing or
	   any non normal attacking. (so if it casts spells or kicks and bashs
	   etc consider may be wrong). At a later date we may try to fix this
	   but it will be something that will take some work.
