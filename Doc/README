This is the documentation of DikuMUD. I have added some examples, on a form
I'd like to get new areas on. Of course, we have to look through everything
sent, carefully, before eventually adding it. To better the chances of 
approval, your area should have an overall athmosphere, that melts well into
the present world of AlexMUD. Also, of course, it should be quality building:-)
(We are not very found of illogical things, like a lot of one way exits etc)
Too powerful items will most likely not be approved on. Read the docs, even
if they are not very good at all points. The most important ones, to building,
are database.doc, dbsup.doc, and values.doc. To see how powerful a monster,
of a certain level, should be, you can check defs.doc

If the docs say 'DO NOT USE', etc, that most often means DO NOT USE!:-)
However, some of the things ARE implemented, so I suggest you ask us, if in
doubt.

Any questions can be discussed, either on the game, or by mail.
I can be reached at:
	nv90-mho@nada.kth.se
	     mho@alex.stacken.kth.se   or
	mudadmin@alex.stacken.kth.se
I can't promise I will be able to answer every question, but I WILL try...

In the examples, I have substituted the zone number with ZZ. You too should 
do this, to enable us to easilly fit the zone in, where we have free numbers.
