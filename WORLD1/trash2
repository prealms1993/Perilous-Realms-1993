  name { The Throne Room of Drow }
  desc {
This is a massive hall, with walls made of solid onyx. The light from a 
massive chandellier illuminates the large hall, making the onyx walls 
glisten. The floor is covered in a thick, deep red shag carpet, except
for an aisle spanning in the center of the hall, which leads to two
thrones. One huge throne, made of gold and ivory, has a demon's leering
face hanging over it's back, and the second, smaller throne has the legs
of a spider curling around the cushion. There are two gold doors, one leading
east, and the other leading west, as well as the exit to the south.

  desc {
This is the room of Rambozo, the Dark Dwarf High Priest of Lolth. This room
is dominated by a large alter, bearing the likeness of the Spider Queen
herself on the sacrifice table, her legs curling up to surround whoever
is unfortunate enough to be placed there. The table is stained the dark
color of the blood of her sacrifices. In the corner, you see a small 
bedchamber, where the High Priest sleeps. The only exit is to the west.

This is the bedroom of Shadowspawn, Prince of the Drow. The bed in here
dominates the entire room. It's canopied in red silk, draping down to the edge
of the red satin sheets. The floor is carpeted in a dark black shag, which
matches the color of the onyx walls. The only exit is east.
