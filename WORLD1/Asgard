			>>>  Rules For Immortals  <<<

 *     Read these periodically, as they are subject to change w/o notice.
 *     Follow these rules strictly. Do not attempt to create loopholes due
       to wording, etc.
 *     Failure to follow the rules will result in demotion to level 1 with
       lousy stats, and a permanant trip to the Abyss.

        1 - The only help you may render a PC is advice. You may not give the
		items, gold, experience, stats on items or MOBs, or cast
		spells on them. Do not help them in fights either.
	2 - Do not hinder PC's either, unless they are breaking rules/being
		extremely obnoxious (repeated shouts, bad language *gasp*,
		ordering multiple followers to shout (just purge/kill the
		followers))

	3 - If you play a mortal character that you had before you became an
		Immortal, you may not aid it in ANY way. You must use this
		character as if they were just a regular mortal.

	4 - If you start a Test Character  once you become Immortal,then this
		character  may not interact with the other normal  mortals.
		This means, no grouping, no helping or hindering (see #1
		and #2), and you better loot ALL corpses of MOBs you kill.
		You may help an Test Char some, but you may not give them
		equipment. Allowed help includes Restore/Healing them, or
		other such spells that affect only your character.

	5 - Do not bring MOBs with 'AGGRESSIVE' in their flags to town. This
		includes so called 'WIMPY/AGGRESSIVES'.

	6 - Do not run a 'Quest' w/o permission from Deth, Alcanzar, Kemper or
		Zucan. Make sure they know ALL of the details, including what
		'reward' there is going to be at the end.

	7 - Do not give out explicit information about MOBs, Items, or Areas.
		You may tell someone that something is Good/Bad, Hard/Easy,
		or a similar vague response.(*NOT* good compared to anything
		just good or bad).

        8 - Do not kill monsters. Do not take monsters equipment.

		If you have any questions, ask a level 2009 or 2010.

     More rules may be coming, and may be made up on the spot by any 2009+
     Promotions are given based on responsible behavior and writing areas
     or new code.
