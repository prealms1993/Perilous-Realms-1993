crackling fire that makes the room warm and cosy, and in front of an oakwood
reading desk is a large old-fashioned chair.

indeed) and a fair collection of horror literature, ranging from Bram Stoker
and H. P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.

You are on a transparent balcony hanging in mid-air.  You notice a faint blue
glow surrounding everything, even yourself, making it seem as transparent as
the balcony itself.  From here, you have a terrific view of the whole Forest
of Haon-Dor.
A transparent bronze plate has been bolted to the balcony railing.
A magical portal is hovering in the air to the west.
