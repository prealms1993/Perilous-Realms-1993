This simulation is offered by the CRL Network as a service                      
to its users. A limited number (20) of free connections to                      
the Mud is provided to non-affiliates.                                          
                                                                                
At this time the number of non-affiliated users connected                       
has exceeded the maximum allowed, and we are not accepting                      
anonymous connections. Please wait at least 10 minutes before                   
reattempting connections. People who try more often risk having
their sites locked.
