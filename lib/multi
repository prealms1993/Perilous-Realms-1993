"MULTIPLE_PLAYERS MULTIPLAYING"

This is very important information. Read it understand it and follow it.
This may seem to be "harsh" but we want a good roleplaying environment
here not one where all people want is instant level 500 or just the best
equipment.

There is NO multiple playing allowed. NONE. This includes dropping link
to get your other player on and exchange equipment. ANY equipment changing
between PC's will most likely be determined as multiple playing. As you can
probably tell you MAY NOT (even with a friends help) exchange equipment 
between your players! Think of each player as a real person who would not
think of giving all his best equipment to some stranger (or even best friend).

STORAGE characters are NOT allowed (see above).

PUNISHMENT for multiple pcs or exchanging equipemnt:
First offense: Banshment to hell for 2 days of both players.
Seconf offense: Banishment for 2 weeks.
Third offense: Deletion of both players.

This is NOT negotible and WILL be carried out.
