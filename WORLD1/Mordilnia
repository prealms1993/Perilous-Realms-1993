"   Although this room is deep beneath the ground, Darkenelf's home is quite
warm, if a bit odd.  Intricate rugs from faraway lands cover the floor, save
for the center, which is a spiralling downward stairway.
   Tapestries as intricate as the rugs, if not more so, alsmot completely
cover the walls, each telling its own complex story.  A chest lies open on
one side of the room, containing many maps and scrolls, as well as a few
jewels and a strange dagger.
   Beside Darkenelf's desk, you see a long table, covered with vials of odd,
strange liquids; some bubbling, some glowing, others making wretched noises.
   On the desk itself, you see rolls of parchment, jars of multicolored ink,
feathered quills, and a few assorted gems.  On the upper section of the desk
rests a lagre reptillian skull on a pedastle, next to which is an ominously
large crystal sphere.
   Southward, you see a rune-covered oaken door.

This being one of few buildings standing in Skara Brae, and being in the best
condition, shows Tarjan's grasping hold over this realm just as well as did
the destruction of the city.
   The sleek, black marble walls of this unholy place glisten as though they
were covered in dimly illuminated rivulets of blood.  The very air of this
place reeks of foulness, though it appears to be thoroughly clean.  Strange
rune patterns are etched carefully into the walls' surfaces.  Their pattern
seems to change as you look at it, so their meanings are indecipherable.
   Two doors, one north, one south, made of blackened iron stand here, each
with a legend written above it.  The northern door has been labelled 'Chaos',
and the southern door has written above it, 'Tarjan'.
   To the west, just outside of the temple, you can see the doomed city of
Skara Brae, solemnly awaiting the end of eternity.
