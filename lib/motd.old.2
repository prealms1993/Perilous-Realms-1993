IMPORTANT NOTE:
    This mud is still very much changing. If you dont want to deal with changes
some good and some maybe bad then this may not be the best mud for you. We are
and will try to do our best efforts to listen to what ideas you have and maybe
use them if they are presented logically and without lots of whining and 
bitching as has happened in the past. We will also try to let you know we have
seen your ideas (if posted or mailed) better than we have in the past, if you
dont get a response though dont feel bad as replying to the 50+ messages I get
a day is very hard to deal with.
Hmm now what is our direction of movement some of you have asked.. Well at 
present we are not 100% sure of this. Some of the planned changes most of you
know already. I think most of the "push towards realism" is over but dont take
my word on this as something may pop up later. We are still looking for a way
to limit items from some other classes besides spell casters and thief types so
this may be where you see some still. We are now trying to make combat much
faster and smoother and there WILL be some major changes (see above notice)
things like critical hits, individual combat speeds, hit points for the 5 (+?)
body locations, limb uselessness, better resistances for items and passing on
of those to people wearing resistant armor, etc. Other things presently going
on is a balancing of the classes skills, spelld and profencies by Gollux. A
review and adjustment of all objects and mobiles by Phantom and when he gets
that done and has a good idea of whats going on we have ~45 areas to put in.
Another SMALL posibility is moving to a skills based mud, this is dependent on
what information Scarrow provides me with and how well he can convince me its
a good idea, I will also be listening to the player input on this idea.
During the summer, job permitting I'd like to improve and add several (read
lots) spells and skills to the game. Now that the spells are working as we had
originally planned (IE casting takes longer than .025 seconds) I plan to improve
some (maybe) or probably even better just add more, and even add some spells 
that affect more than one room (nova is one). Other things I'm looking towards
doing in the future are adding ranged combat if we can decide on a good way to
do it, traps and room puzzles (maybe something like eob where you flip a bunch
of switchs or stand on plates to make things happen), mounts that are something
besides just something to ride so you dont lose moves (and not necessarily for
just attacking either), fixing up the rest of the shops in town and more little
things i'm sure.
I know alot of you think we dont care what goes on and people have left because
they got pissed at our changes but I am really not in the least interested to
look like what "all the rest of the dikumuds" out there look like. If you want
to be part of a better generation of mud (I hope anyway and I hate to call it
Diku mud as we may be changing the name since almost 100% of the code has been
changed) then hang around and give us your input. If you just want to play and
have no interest in anything I have said well then please dont bitch when we
changes something. I guess a good warning is dont get to set into your ways we
change much more than any mud thats been around for 2 years that I have seen.
Well enough of my rambling on I just wanted to post this and let people know
whats going on.. I have debated going back into a registration only test mode
to try to get the better people (IE contributers not bitchers) on the game but
I have decided against it because I want to get the full range of opinions not
just some few population of testers picked by me or another god.
