You are surrounded by stagnant brown sludge which could be called
a river.  It runs to the west from here and you are unable to see
an exit from the river in the way west.  You can leave and enter
Mirkwood to the north.  You sense a need to move quickly before you
die from the stench of this sludge.

You are surrounded by foul smelling sludge.  This place is extremely
gross. The sludge river stagnates to the west and the east.  The smell
is enough to kill you.  The river doesn't move like a normal river.

you to leave this horrod river.
