IMPORTANT NEW STUFF:
Teleport rooms use events now.  Like river rooms, their timing is much more
reliable now.  They can also, like rivers now, be nearly any speed (1 being
the fastest).

River rooms use events now.  Their timing should be much more reliable (i.e.,
unless they're fast they won't trigger immediately when you enter ... if you
enter and then someone else does, you'll flow down the river first).  Builders
no longer have to make rivers a certain range of speeds, but can instead
specify nearly anything (but beware, a speed of 1 is pretty darned fast).

Spells can be non-verbal, etc.  This means some spells don't make as much
noise and don't give as much forewarning.  You can now target spells without
your targets being checked until the completion of the spell.  You can now
use the keywords "self", "me" or "myself" in many places to refer to yourself
without using your name.

The event system was entirely redone, as was mobile death.  This will
hopefully speed up things, kick out a few bugs, etc.

Many minor bugs were fixed.  There may be more out there lurking, so remember
to report them if you find them, and try to tell us how we can duplicate the
effect ourselves.

Varying attack speeds are in.  Your speed depends upon several factors,
including your choice of weapon.  It's a bit different and may take getting
used to.  Leave comments to us, as usual.  Right now secondary weapons aren't
of much use, but I plan to remedy it later.

AID is a skill now instead of a spell.  It has been adjusted to work as
described in the help on the subject.

Passwords will now expire and also are required to be a bit more secure.  The
MOTD will only show up if it is newer than the last time you read it.  You can
still read it via the MOTD command, of course.  Your last logon date and site
are shown for your security.  A new command, FINGER, allows you to view some
information about other players.  You can enter in your own finger information
at the main menu.

Some IMPORTANT help you should read:
DEFAULTSPELL, SKILLS, SPELLS, CHANGES, DEATH, PRAY, STORAGE, MULTIPLAY, AGGR,
PRIORITY, SACRIFICE, PROFICIENCY, MOTD, CONSENT, DAMAGED ITEMS, INSURANCE,
CHOOSE, LOCATIONS, COMBAT, EXITS, EXPERIENCE, PROMPT, CODES, MAIL, MUD_INFO

You should REALLY read these as they are not the same as any other mud.
If you dont read some of them you can get into BIG trouble!

NOTE: AUTOROLLING PROGRAMS ARE *VERY* LIKELY TO GET YOUR SITE BANNED

Not sure why the game keeps dying looks like a possible swap memory problem
if it dies again while i'm at work it will probably stay down unless scarrow
shows up.
