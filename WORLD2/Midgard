Welcome to New Midgard.

We hope that you won't get lost, but if you ever do, just keep walking
till you see a large block of marble embedded into the ground.  They're
usually found at most major intersections and always have a map eteched
on their surface.  To help you get started, there are several posters
here you can look at.
The STREET map will show you how the layout works around here.
The GUILD poster has a map of where all the guilds in town are located.
and the ZONE poster will give you a feel as to what parts of town might
   carry what shops.
Oh yeah...I almost forgot.  There's also a SHOP poster which will tell
you where to find just about anything!

Happy Traveling! (And don't forget to look for those MAPS at all major
intersections...they'll keep you on the right track!)
