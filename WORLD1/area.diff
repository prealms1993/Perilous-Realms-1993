< The STREET map will show you how the layout works around here.
< The GUILD poster has a map of where all the guilds in town are located.

<    carry what shops.
< Oh yeah...I almost forgot.  There's also a SHOP poster which will tell
< you where to find just about anything!

< Happy Traveling! (And don't forget to look for those MAPS at all major
