"   You are lounging in a quiet cozy parlor, warmed by a gentle magical fire
which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  There are no doors out.  Clearly

"   You see here a cozy little room with a fireplace.  You can tell it is Moses'
room by the two stone tablets and a bible on a small ledge near the fireplace.
This room was designed for total relaxation.  You can watch television, listen
to the stereo, even soak in a hot tub.
There is a bell here for the butler.
