The tunnel widens as it continues east. The white walls could make weaker
people feel sick. Still, it is nice and quiet here. Wonder why??

Hmmm.... Now what? Should you continue east, or north. Perhaps if you are

To the east, you hear a lot of noise and you notice an odd smell. Still the

Ah, now this is more like home! This must be where the ant's actually live.
This place is a mess. If it weren't for the sickly white walls and all these
