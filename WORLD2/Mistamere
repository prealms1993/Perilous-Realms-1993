You see a circular room, about 40 feet in diameter, with eight openings
spaced evenly about the outside wall. The windows extend from about waist
height to about head height for a normal human. These are obviously ports
through which arrows can be fired. The room appears to be empty except for
the remains of a skeleton on the floor.

clothing, a rack to hold weapons,  and a long table with a drawer that
might have once served as a desk. there are moth eaten clothes on the bed,
but the room appears to be otherwise empty.
