Other Stuff:
------------
Lag reducer: To reduce lag, we have made it so that messages get "folded"
so that if you were to recieve "You are pounded" 10 times, you will now  
recieve "(10*)You are pounded".

Astral walk has been removed and replaced with portal usage is the same

You now gain exp for the amount of damage you do to a mob BUT this is subtracted
from the mobs exp. What this means is the people doing the most damage get more
exp and then whats left at kill time gets split between everyone.

Barbarians now have a limit of 5000 hps this may be to low still (or to high but
I doubt that) I will see..


Barbarians can now read when they get to a sufficently hi level (ie recall)
------------

Barbarians are now not affected by poison

and probably everyones favorite  puff will fix weapons for you (if you find her)
the cost is not cheap.

Vitalize mana was removed for clerics and recharger put in its place.

Bards "new" thing (for lack of better wording) they will be able to use any 
armor or weapon in the game due to their knowledge of the world.

------------
Number of kills now affects EXP. 0-20 = full exp, 21-40 = 4/5 exp, 41-60 = 3/5,
61-80=2/5, 81-100 = 1/5, 101 = 5% exp

Cursed items, are now impossible to put in bags and drop. you also cannot
junk them. Your only way to lose them is pay a nice cleric to remove curse.

Astral walk/transmove/telemove all now can and do fail and are much more
reasonable spells.

Storage chars are frowned upon and subject to deletion.

We DO NOT tolerate people shouting OR gossiping LAG in any form whats so ever.
This includes "Boy this lag sucks!" "LLLLLLAAAAGGGG" etc etc if it has the word
lag in it dont say it where a god can hear it. The reason for this policy is
that you dont help by adding more output to peoples screens and we get tired
of hearing it. You WILL be silenced or noshouted if you do it.

There is now a FINE for staying link dead for to long (45 min) and if you
do it to often in smaller time limits you will also be fined.

------------

There will soon be size limits on equipment soon.  For example, two handed
swords will not be usable by pixies, and giants won't be able to wear pixie armor.
