A sign on the far wall reads "Welcome to my home, you can visit for as long
as you like, but please clean up after yourself. - Darrel"
Around the room you notice various scenes of battle woven into tapestries
hanging from the wall.  In the center of room stands a large table
overflowing with food and drink.  Next to the far wall stands a full suit
of glowing armor and a huge flaming two-handed sword.  Along the walls
torches burn, providing light.  You begin to wonder if you are really
welcome here.
