This small room houses three very strange paintings.  The first one, on the 
north wall, depicts a scene of a dark forest, with a dark mansion in the far
distance.  The second, on the south wall, shows a large fire consuming 
everything.  The third, on the east wall, is a portrait of a handsome man,
with claw marks cutting across the painting, leaving bloody streaks.  The
scenes in the paintings writhe and move, with a life of their own.
