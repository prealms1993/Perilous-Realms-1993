Please be aware V2 is not going to be a Dikumud based server. The new server
will allow for ALOT of things that are different (rooms within rooms within
objects within people etc etc) (a room within a whale.. a room inside a tree
and so on will all be possible). For now your building on the V1 server for
V2 until we can get V2 done enough for building.
ALSO please note that in V2 the emphasis wont be on as much combat as it will
be on ROLEPLAYING *ALL* areas should encourage THINKING and roleplaying as
much as possible. At present I'm trying to work out a skills based system
which means no levels and no exp (no pracs either) things will be learned
based by doing them and difficulty (and other things) you need to plan around
ALL of this and not plan on as much combat as V1 had. All puzzles locks etc
will have a difficulty level rating please keep a track of what you want them
set at as you make them so that they can be set later!
 
*ANY* Builder who is not active will be replaced/removed! I expect you to
make all meetings that I post on the crl site (which means check in each day
on crl) meetings will be held here. I dont want a bunch of people who are just
going to goof off all the time.. If you cant make a meeting notify a 2009+
