A huge cloud forms the plateau on which you are now standing. The wind here
is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly upon you. From under the
cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard. Right before you to the
north lies the grand Mansion of Naris, the residence of the Greater God
Redferne.

You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
the pleasent feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.
