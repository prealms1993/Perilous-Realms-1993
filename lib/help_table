FINGER

Finger allows you to see some information provided by other players.  You can
set the info from the main menu.  To view a player's finger information use:

   finger <name>

Information about your e-mail address is viewable only by high level immortals,
so if you wish to make it visible to other players, put it in your plan as
well.

DEATH

Death is a very nasty thing. It usually means you didnt kill that mob or ran
into a rather nasty trap. Death here is a bit different, you lose your exp
like normal BUT you will also lose levels/mana/hps down to the max level you
can have with your new exp total (note, this can happen by fleeing alot as well)
You will not gain any new practices until you reach your old level but anything
you had already learned will stay practiced (just not useable until your the
correct level again).
Currently when you die it is impossible to have your corpse looted by PLAYERS
but mobs are able to if they are smart enough (most are). The only times when
this isnt true is if you have CHOOSEN or if you have given CONSENT to someone

#
STORAGE STORAGE_CHARACTERS

The bank will hold items for you now. It wont hold any item worth less than
1k gold and you will be charged for their service at what would be normal
renting prices if we charged rent. To deposit an item you type deposit <item>
to list items type list and to withdraw you type withdraw <item>. You are
charged once a real day or when you withdraw an item you are charged for part
of the day (based on deposite time).

please note STORAGE CHARACTERS are *NOT* allowed and will be deleted if you
are caught. You will also face banishment for some time and if you do it to
much you will face deletion as well.

MUD_INFO
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:
    This mud is still very much changing. If you dont want to deal with changes
some good and some maybe bad then this may not be the best mud for you. We are
and will try to do our best efforts to listen to what ideas you have and maybe
use them if they are presented logically and without lots of whining and 
bitching as has happened in the past. We will also try to let you know we have
seen your ideas (if posted or mailed) better than we have in the past, if you
dont get a response though dont feel bad as replying to the 50+ messages I get
a day is very hard to deal with.
Hmm now what is our direction of movement some of you have asked.. Well at 
present we are not 100% sure of this. Some of the planned changes most of you
know already. I think most of the "push towards realism" is over but dont take
my word on this as something may pop up later. We are still looking for a way
to limit items from some other classes besides spell casters and thief types so
this may be where you see some still. We are now trying to make combat much
faster and smoother and there WILL be some major changes (see above notice)
things like critical hits, individual combat speeds, hit points for the 5 (+?)
body locations, limb uselessness, better resistances for items and passing on
of those to people wearing resistant armor, etc. Other things presently going
on is a balancing of the classes skills, spelld and profencies by Gollux. A
review and adjustment of all objects and mobiles by Phantom and when he gets
that done and has a good idea of whats going on we have ~45 areas to put in.
Another SMALL posibility is moving to a skills based mud, this is dependent on
what information Scarrow provides me with and how well he can convince me its
a good idea, I will also be listening to the player input on this idea.
During the summer, job permitting I'd like to improve and add several (read
lots) spells and skills to the game. Now that the spells are working as we had
originally planned (IE casting takes longer than .025 seconds) I plan to improve
some (maybe) or probably even better just add more, and even add some spells 
that affect more than one room (nova is one). Other things I'm looking towards
doing in the future are adding ranged combat if we can decide on a good way to
do it, traps and room puzzles (maybe something like eob where you flip a bunch
of switchs or stand on plates to make things happen), mounts that are something
besides just something to ride so you dont lose moves (and not necessarily for
just attacking either), fixing up the rest of the shops in town and more little
things i'm sure.
I know alot of you think we dont care what goes on and people have left because
they got pissed at our changes but I am really not in the least interested to
look like what "all the rest of the dikumuds" out there look like. If you want
to be part of a better generation of mud (I hope anyway and I hate to call it
Diku mud as we may be changing the name since almost 100% of the code has been
changed) then hang around and give us your input. If you just want to play and
have no interest in anything I have said well then please dont bitch when we
changes something. I guess a good warning is dont get to set into your ways we
change much more than any mud thats been around for 2 years that I have seen.
Well enough of my rambling on I just wanted to post this and let people know
whats going on.. I have debated going back into a registration only test mode
to try to get the better people (IE contributers not bitchers) on the game but
I have decided against it because I want to get the full range of opinions not
just some few population of testers picked by me or another god.

PRIORITY PRIORITIES STACKING

With priority toggled on, some commands will take priority over others.  As it
currently works, flee is the highest priority command, rescue second highest,
and save third highest.  Flee will also flush all previously stacked commands.
Delays will still stop commands from going through until the delay expires.
For example, lets say I had just bashed a monster and was delayed for two
rounds.  If I had stacked bash, bash, flee, the two bashes would be thrown
away and the flee would occur after the two round delay wore off.

#
SACRIFICE

At your chosen temple, attempt to sacrifice an object of power to your deity
in return for possible magical benefits and restoration of alignment.  Only
rare artifacts or magical items can be so sacrificed.

#
PROFICIENCY PROFICIENCIES PROFS

Weapon proficiencies are required for accurate weapon usage by a character.
A proficiency represents an area of skill covering one fairly specific weapon
class (for example, a shortsword).  Proficiencies are practiced just like
skills.  The proficiencies for your class can be viewed by using the
PROFICIENCIES command.  In addition, you can see your currently practiced
values by using the PRACTICE command.

See also --
  SKILLS, PRACTICE, DUAL WIELD

#
"DUAL WIELD"

The skill dual wield is used to allow a character to fight with proficiency
with two weapons wielded at once.  Without this skill, wielding two weapons
will achieve little affect.

#
PRAY PRAYING

This command is meant to be used by clerics (or anyone using mana as their
source of power).  While praying, a cleric will gain extra mana back each
tick.  In addition, praying at the temple of your chosen alignment will gain
back mana at an even higher rate.

#
MULTIPLE_PLAYERS MULTIPLAYING

This is very important information. Read it understand it and follow it.
This may seem to be "harsh" but we want a good roleplaying environment
here not one where all people want is instant level 500 or just the best
equipment.

There is NO multiple playing allowed. NONE. This includes dropping link
to get your other player on and exchange equipment. ANY equipment changing
between PC's will most likely be determined as multiple playing. As you can
probably tell you MAY NOT (even with a friends help) exchange equipment 
between your players! Think of each player as a real person who would not
think of giving all his best equipment to some stranger (or even best friend).

STORAGE characters are NOT allowed (see above).

PUNISHMENT for multiple pcs or exchanging equipemnt:
First offense: Banshment to hell for 2 days of both players.
Seconf offense: Banishment for 2 weeks.
Third offense: Deletion of both players.

This is NOT negotible and WILL be carried out.

#
MOTD "MESSAGE OF THE DAY"

This command allows you to re-read the message of the day, in the event you
missed it or (in rare cases) it was updated while you were online.  Remember
to stay informed via MOTD, NEWS and the bulletin board.

RECHARGER

Recharger will let other PC's act like a battery for you to get mana from.
You can only cast this on someone who has given you their CONSENT and who
hasnt been used for a recharge for the last 48 ticks. There is a small
detriment to the battery, they will lose 20 hps for the 48 hour duration.
This is not perminate. You can only use this on a PC within 40 levels of
you.

  Arachnos      -- Duke     (5 - 50)
  Castle Python -- Melkor   (5 - 30)

NOTE!!!!!!!!
	Those numbers are ROUGH!  And just because an area is advertised
for X level does not necessarily mean that X level can wipe out the area!!!
Use COMMON SENSE.  ASK people about the areas, find experienced people to
group with.  Don't get cocky, and you'll live longer.   Be social, and you
will live longer.  Ask questions, and you will live longer.

P.S. if anyone feels these numbers are not accurate, post a message.

undoubtedly find some that are too strong, or some that are too
weak in comparison to the others in the room

I would be very grateful if you tell me which ones are too strong
and which ones are too weak.

If you switch into a humanoid monster, you can cast spells if you are a

SPELL_INFO

How spells now work:
Spells do #d# * (your level+1 - spell learn lvl)  damage if its offensive.

Example: magic missile learnable at lvl 3 does: 1d4*1  if your lvl 3
 at lvl 4 it does 1d4*2 at 5,  1d4*3 and so on the highest multiplier
 on most spells is 20.  So the highest magic missile can get is 1d4*20

heres a list of all MU aggr spells

magic missile     1d4
shocking grasp    1d6
chill thouch      1d8*2  (not multiplied by lvl)
lightning bolt    1d8
burning hands     1d3
acid blast        2d8
ice storm         2d10
cone of cold      3d8
color spray       3d10
fireball          4d8
shriek            4d9
meteor swarm      5d8
mage fire         5d9

now for another example: say you just learned mage fire (lvl 125) it does:
5d9*1 you gain a level and it does 5d9*2  gain another 5d9*3  and so on up to 20

#
KILL HIT

Syntax:  hit [monster] [location]

A good way to start a fight.  After the name of the monster that you
want to kill, you have the option to aim for a certain location of
the body.  Possible locations are feet, legs, arms, body, and head.
Aiming is useful when you want to attack a monster in a certain
place.  For example, a warrior might have heavily armored arms
and legs, but not much in the body.  In that case, 'hit warrior body'
would be a good choice.  For more information, see HELP LOCATIONS.
#
LOCATIONS

The five primary hit locations are: feet, legs, body, arms, head.
For monsters whose anatomy doesn't quite match up to a humanoid's,
the locations are substituded with more realistic ones.  For
example, a dragon might have locatios claws, legs, body, wings, head
or a spider might have feet, legs, body, legs, head.

When you attack a certain location, whether or not you hit depends
on the relative height differences and how well the location is
armored.  A giant would have an easy time hitting a gnome's head,
but the gnome would have a bit of difficulty hitting the giant's!

Hitting a certain location also has the potention of doing more
or less damage.  For example, hit a hit to the arm scores only
80% of the damage a hit to the body would.

Consider all of this when initiating combat.

CrossReference:  See HELP COMBAT
#
COMBAT

There are several things to remember in order to be successful in
combat.   The first is that you can attack a monster in five different
location: the feet, legs, arms, body and head.  Certain locations are
armoured differently, so those might be good places to strike.  Also,
hitting a limb does a bit less damage then hitting the head or body.
Plus, some armor now absorbs melee damage...thus reducing the amount
of hitpoints both you and the mob will take.  Consider all of this
when attacking.  For example.

Lashi considers killing a dragon.  He could attack in the body, head,
or a limb.  Lashi figures that the wings are fragile and are less
armoured than the body, thus he could hit the dragon more often there.
He also considers that a hit to the wing won't do as much damage as
a hit to the body.  Finally, he decides that, since the wing has less
stopping power, he could actually do more damage to the wing than
to the body.  Of course, this is all moot, because Lashi is a pixie
and has no chance of hitting a dragon's wings (he's too small) :)

#
KICK

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The
higher level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch -
whenever you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for
three rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!

Fighters See Also : Rescue, Bash
#
BASH

  The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned. To bash
someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you
will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear.
The victim will be unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of
violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall.
  A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.
Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict
1.5*damage.  Fighters See Also : Rescue, Kick
#
RESCUE

  A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the
person being rescued. You can only 'turn' one monster for each
attempt. This is highly useful when playing in groups.
#
STEAL

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not
getting caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if
the person is asleep.

Example:

  > steal gold drunk

#
BACKSTAB

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in
his bag, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well
you have practiced backstab at your guild.

If you are an assassin, see HELP ASSASSINATE for more information.
#
CAST
For "magical" people. If you want to throw a spell at someone or something.
Example : cast 'burning hands' <player>
   Note that the name of the spell must be enclosed by "'"s.

See also : help on each individual spell, for example:
  > help cure ligh
  > help ventri
  > help energy drain
#
DROP
If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.
Example : drop bottle
  If you feel like getting rid of all your earthly possessions, you
may use "drop all".  Also you can drop 9*bottle, which would drop 9
bottles, but leave the rest in your hands.
  You can also type drop all*bottle to drop all of the bottles you have.

See also: GET
#
PURGE

  purge <object>                Figure this one out yourself.
  purge room                    imp only

#
PSTAT
  If you are interested in a person and want to find out about
his/her/its skills, strength, mana, hitpoints etc. In addition, 'stat
room' will give you useful information about the room you are in.

#
MSTAT

     Shows you the stats of a given mob.
#
RSTAT

     This command will display almost everything you need to know about
a room (it only works for the room you are in, unless you use  mat or
at).  It will display the sector type, room flags, all exits along with
their flags and any exdscs, all characters currently in the room, and all
objects in the room.
#
STAT

     Stat <object>  will show you all of the characteristics of a given
object.  The ONLY reason to do this is if you are looking at examples while
making your own objects, or if a player thinks their equipment is bugged.
In other words, DON'T STAT OBJECTS FOR MORTALS!!  :)
#
NOHASSLE

     This command toggles your nohassle setting (immortals only).  If you
turn on nohassle, aggressive mobs will not attack you.  To turn it back
off, just enter  nohassle  again.  Be SURE to turn on nohassle if you are
going to be near aggressive mobs in the mortal areas.  It is Bad Form to
end up hurting a mob because you forge to set nohassle and it attacked
you.
#
ORDER

there are some things they just wont do though...

#
BUY SELL
Commands for the shops - very useful too !
#

#
READ
When you want to read something.
#

#
SHOPS
  Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to
survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!
  To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect
is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and
can shoot through schools).

NOTE FOR THE CLUELESS: shops dont work without shopkeepers

#
COMMANDS
A mechanical listing (the code already exists) of the known verbs.
#
WARRIOR FIGHTER

  Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills
of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.
However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort.
  You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the
last room)

See also: PRACTICE
#
THIEF
  Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other
class offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many
situations, such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented,
however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.
The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead,
avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying
items at the black market.
   You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
CLERIC
  This class gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing,
though it is possible to learn more violent spells.  You can improve
your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
"MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE
  This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user
does not control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such. You
can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE
  Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <##> <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to use this, it
can be accumulated.

Example:
  practice 30 bash
  practice 5 kick
  practice magic missile
#
EXITS
  Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location. Of course,
the less obvious ones will not show up here - you have to THINK in
order to locate those.

NOTE: secret exits are IMPOSSIBLE to detect here by moving a direction
you "think" a door may be. The keyword SECRET will also NOT WORK.
You must look at room desc's to find some exits!!

#
LEAVE
  If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the
nearest obvious exit to the outside.

#
ENTER
  If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you will enter any
nearby shelter.  You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for
example, 'enter window'.

#
TIME
  Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the
output of this command may be one of surprise, but you will get used
to it. you will have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game
depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example.

#
BUG TYPO IDEA
For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. Examples:

bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'
idea make a restaurant in Midgaard
typo 'sence' should be spelled 'sense'

NOTE: level 2+
#
QUIT
  When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing
'quit'. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is
simply left on the ground. If you wish to have your equipment put away
until you are able to come back, you will have to find an inn.

You may safely quit at the fountain MOST of the time but dont make a
habbit of it there are times when you CANT and you WONT be reimbursed!
you *CANNOT* safely quit anywhere else.

See also: INN
#
INN INNS
  Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the
innkeeper looks after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you
may use inns to store your gathered equipment while you are not
playing the game (we all have to sleep sometimes, there is no shame in
that).

See also: RENT
#
RENT

'rent' will store the items and make you leave the game. The next time
you enter, you will start out in the reception where you left.

See also: INN
#
GET TAKE
  If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get'
to pick it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if
you just feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use
'get' to extract objects from containers. Example: "get dagger from
bag".  Other examples:
  get all.bread from bag
  get 9*bread from bag
  get all from corpse

Fixed! There is no longer any ambiguity between containers in your
inventory and on the ground.  The ones in your inventory are 1..n and
the ones on the ground are (n+1)..(n+m).

See also: DROP PUT
#
PUT
For putting stuff in containers. Example: "Put the dagger in the bag".
  Put all.bread in bag
  Put 9*bread in bag.

similar), and a pen of some sort. You can then type: write note pen
whereupon you will be asked to type in your note at the keyboard.

#
NEWS
  This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD
Herald", a publication dedicated to news and useful information about
this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while.
NOT checking it out will probably get you DEAD.

#
SLEEPING WAKE REST SIT STAND
  For changing your position. If you feel weary, It is probably a good
idea to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.

#
POUR
If you want to pour some liquid from one container to another.
#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE
#
FOLLOW
  If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why
not simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are
following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have
to do is follow yourself: "follow <your name>".

#
FLEE
  If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type 'flee', and
presto! you are out of harm's way - that is, IF you are still standing
and, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit does not
simply take you out of the frying pan and into the fire... but then,
who wants to live forever?

#
IMPLEMENTOR BOSS

TAKE NOTE:
  The most powerful beings in existence.  Their function is mostly
administrative.  Don't whine too much in their presence.
  Also, Alcanzar doesn't have the responsibilities of an implementor,
just the priveleges.  He only hacks code.

ASK LOWER IMMORTALS FOR HELP FIRST!!!

#
GUILD
  The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the
troubles and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded
(HA!), so that only members may enter the building. Guilds are also
the places where people come to learn and practice the skills of their
trade.

See also: PRACTICE, GAIN
#
INFO
Gives you some useful hints and information about the game.
#
USERS

     Tells you who is logged on to the game, and where they are playing
from.  The output can be formatted using the following flags:

         Usage: users [-c] [-t] [-l] [-h] [-i] [-c]
         Example: users -i -c -h
                 -c : condensed
                 -l : sorted by level
                 -h : sorted by host
                 -n : sorted by name
                 -i : immortals only
                 -t : totals only

#
LEVELS
no longer in use.

now use: level # # or level #

         level 1 lists exp range for level 1
#
BRIEF
  Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you do not see the
descriptions of the room you are in; only the name of the room, and
the people and objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the
area in which you travel, however, it is not advisable to use this
command.

***Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the
descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your surroundings could
mean the difference between life and death!***

See also: COMPACT
#
!
Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
#
CONSIDER
Usage : consider <monster>

Consider has been completely re-written to be more accurate.  It now
works by running a simulated combat between you and the monster and
seeing who will win...and by how much.  Thus, you could consider
a monster _during_ a fight and receive update information (you're
updated chance of victory).   Consider will also tell you the relative
height difference between you and the monster. (see HELP COMBAT)

Special Note:  Consider ONLY takes melee combat into account.   Things
like kick, bash, backstab, and spells are NOT considered.

Example:
Consider dragon.

Not a problem.
A black dragon is a bit taller than you.
#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.
When enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  Things
you should know about experience points:

     If you are in a group, your share of experience from a kill will
     be based on your level relative to the levels of other group
     members.

     The most experience you can get for a kill is 3K*(your level)/(the
     number of clases you are in).

     During combat, players get 1 exp for every 5 hps damage they do.
     These combat exp points are SUBTRACTED from the exp of the mob,
     so a mob will generally have less exp when it dies than it did
     before it was attacked.

#
GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only
be shared among group members that are in the room at the time of the
killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have
been participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader
should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group
membership for each player in the group, by using "group

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

for example).

      Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.

Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it. Contact Deth
if you want to build.  Ask other immortals for help if you have any questions.

#
BREATH
  The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another
monster.  The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a
monster with such an ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a
potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/lightning breath.

  If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will
breath on the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you
must supply the name of a target to breath on.

  Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders
with the same breath.

  This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will
always hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group,
followers and his leader.  You will also probably blast anyone
currently hitting on you.  You also have a small chance (less than
half) of hitting each bystander (someone not covered above).  They
will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat the snot out
of you.

  When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE
time.  If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode
inside you causing half of its normal damage.  These potions also
reduce your CON for the duration of the spell.  You therefore cannot
quaff more breath weapon levels than you have constitution.  You also
cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you have levels.

  The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your
level, and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath
weapon's level it will do your hitpoints worth of damage to the
target.  If your level is double the level of the breath weapon it
will only do half your hitpoints of damage.  Monsters natural breath
weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level monster can
do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this can
be a LOT of damage.  do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

#
ASSIST

  If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same
person the <player> is.

  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting.
It is better than KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose
between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room).
Even though monsters of the same type assist each other in combat,
ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much faster.

OCREATE

Syntax:
  ocreate new #
  ocreate old #
  ocreate one Name *** 2009+ only

 ocreate new #    will load into your workspace a blank object with the
                  given virtual #

 ocreate old #    will load into your workspace a copy of the object # that
                  you previously saved with osave

 ocreate one Name will search the world for an object with the given
                 Name.  Changes that you make on this will instantly be
                  reflected on the object, even if it is in use.
                  You do not need to use osave with this.

If you use ocreate and you have not previously saved your workspace with
osave, your workspace will be cleared.  So if you mess up on an object,
and want to start from scratch, just just ocreate new # again.  If you
oload an object right after ocreating it, and don't osave first, you will
get one copy of the object BUT will not be able to save it afterwards.

NOTES:
    1) Player bits do not and will not work, so don't bother using them.
    2) If you want a certain item to have stats beyond what ocreate will

  there, it will be overwritten.
#
OLOOK
Syntax:
  olook

  olook will show you a copy of your workspace.  It has almost the same
  format as stat.
#
OEDIT

Syntax:

Note: if you use oedit without parameters, it will list the legal fields.

Currently, the legal fields are:
  value1 - value4 : Each item uses different sets of these  (See OVALUE)
  type:  What type of item is it                            (See OTYPE)

             @ <return>
  action: DONT USE
  extra:
        These are the extra descriptions.  Here is how you would use it:
        oedit extra handle

          The above values for drunkness/fullness/thirst are used per
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!
          Example:
            Dragon empties a bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.
            His Drunkness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
            His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
            His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making
               him More thirsty.

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero
          for any drunkness/fullness/thirst the person will be
          sober, hungry, or thirsty respectively.

SPELL-INFO
Since the level versus average damage calculations are performed as shown
in "spell_info.doc" all the offensive spells are individually much stronger
than higher level spells. For example:

  1 fireball of level 15 gives more damage than one of level 16 which give
    more damage than level 17 which give more damage than level 18 which
    give more.... etc.

  Thus please make all offensive potions/scrolls/etc. as the basic level
  they are designed for. You can see the level below. You can see the spells
  average damage, by looking at the spell versus the level of the spell,
  divided by the number of spells learned at that particular level. Example:

  Level 9 Lightning bolt give (102/2) average damage. Divided by 2, because
          this is the level at which it is first learned (You can almost
          always cast two spells are first learned level). At level 10 it
          gives (120/3) average damage.

Looking at the table in "spell_info.doc", you should know that each spell
is designed so that it will kill a victim three levels below the mana user,
if the manauser ONLY cast his spell....

#
PROMPT

Perilous Realms supports a flexible prompt system.. You can configure the prompt
however you like best.

We now can also support COLOR and multi line prompts and if you support true
vt100 you can have nonscrolling prompts along with whatever else you can dream
up.  SEE HELP CODES for a listing of some of the escape codes you can use.

Syntax:
	prompt 'format'
    or  prompt number

Using prompt number, you can choose a pre-made prompt.  For example, prompt 3
would give you a prompt just like PukeMud (Judy).  Prompt's 1 and 2 are meant for
immortals, and won't do much for mortals :)

With prompt 'format', format is as follows:
	Chacters in the format string not following a % sign are echoed back
out in your prompt.  The % is the prefix character for ceartain types of
substitutions.  Here is a sample prompt command line:

	prompt 'H:%h M:%m V:%v> '

Your prompt would then look like:
H:104 M:100 V:140>
Which mean you currently have 104 hp, 100 mana, and 140 movement points.

Here is a complete list of the % commands.  Case is IMPORTANT.
%h - Current hit points
%H - Maximum hit points
%m - Current mana
%M - Maximum mana
%p - Current power
%P - Maximum power
%v - Current Movement
%V - Maximum Movement
%o - Percent of maximum hp of opponent
%O - Name of opponent
%i - If you are invisible, this will be turned into a *, otherwise, blank
%l - Percent of maximum hp of leader
%L - Name of leader
%x - Current experience points
%X - Experience needed for level (negative if you can advance)
%g - How much gold you have
%G - How much gold you have in the bank
%% - tranlated to just a % sign

>2001:Immortal Only
>2001:%r - Current room number
>2001:%I - Invis level

There are also a few \ escape sequences:
\e - escape for making nifty prompts with color etc
\n - newline
\r - carriage return
\\ - echo a single \

Example prompts (using escape codes, this is not necessary it just makes them
look alot neater):

prompt '\e[47;31mH:%h\e[32m M:%m\e[34m V:%v\e[30m>\e[0m '   (H M V  in color)
prompt '\e[40;31mH:%h\e[32m M:%m\e[34m V:%v\e[37m>\e[0m '   (reverse of above)
prompt '\e[1mH:%h>\e[0m '      (hp in intense white)
prompt '\e[47;30mH:%h>\e[0m '   (hp on a reverse video background)

If you think you have made a neat prompt let use know and we will include it
in the prompt # stuff.
#
FLAGS

Let Deth or Alcanzar know if you need/want more room flags.

DARK             1

                        two people are present
NO_GOTO       1024     Can't enter at all if not an Implementor

NEUTRAL_ONLY  4096
EVIL_ONLY     8192
LORD_ONLY    16384     Can only enter if Lord or higher
RENTABLE     32768     If you quit here, you will keep your stuff
ARENA        65536     Makes room an Arena room.
FAST_MANA   131072     Mana regenerates quickly
FAST_HIT    262144
FAST_MOVE   524288
MAPABLE    1048576     Map command works at this location
NOSHOWEXIT 2097152     Prevents normal display of exits
FALL       4194304     Character forced to exit down unless flying
                       (causes damage)

To set multiple flags on a room using either edit fs or edit
addflag, simply add up the values of all the flags you want
and use that number.

#
XIT_EDIT

Syntax:  edit exit  <dir> <door flags> <key> <to_room> [keywords]
     ALL fields, except keywords must be present even if you dont
want a key.  If there is no key, set the key field to -1.  To remove
an exit (and the exdsc associated with it, if any), edit the exit and
set all of the fields to -1.

door flags are:

       NO_DOOR                0
       DOOR                   1
       DOOR_UNPICKABLE        2
       DOOR_SECRET            3
       DOOR_SECRET_UNPICKABLE 4

NOTE: secret doors ARE NOT detectable AT ALL by walking in the
direction they are BUT immortals will ALWAYS see them. SO you
*MUST* leave clues about the door or it will be useless, as no
one will ever see it.  If you want to create an exdsc (description
seen when a character looks in the exit direction), use
edit exdsc <dir>  You will be prompted for text. The <dir> field
must be one of the following numbers:

     0 = North, 1 = East, 2 = South, 3 = West, 4 = Up, 5 = Down
#
RIV_EDIT

     River rooms must be set using the river sector type (7) and the
                     edit riv <speed> <dir>
command.  You can't enter a river room without either fly or a boat item.
If you are flying, nothing unusual will happen.  If you are on a boat, you
will be forced to exit in the <dir> direction, and will see a message
saying "You float down the river..."  Needless to say, there must be
an exit going in the direction that your river flows for it to work.
#
TELE_EDIT

     Teleport rooms simply teleport anything/anyone (this includes mobs,
objs, and players) to the destination room after they a certain duration.
It is important to take into consideration that the real time it takes
between entrance and teleport will vary depending on how fast the machine
happens to be running.  If you want the players to see that they have been
teleported, set the <look-flag> to any non-zero number.  Setting it to zero
means that they will not notice they have been teleported unless they
specifically look at the room.

#
OLOAD

oload without a paramter transfers your workspace to your inventory
oload with a number loads that item into your inventory
to edit that item more you must ocreate old it again

NOTE: save your item before you oload it or you olose it ;)

See Deth for a building zone.

Please note that PR likes to have UNIQUE zones and prefers that if someone 
builds here they not share it with other muds. Give players a reason to come
see your area (mainly it not being on 2 or 10 muds) keep it to 1 mud if at
all possible please. (we will accept areas from other muds as well but they
would have to be very well done or "popular")

#
MAIL

Perilous Realms has a mail system based on mail daemons.  To send someone mail,
go to the Provisions Shop on buy a pen and a note, then type "write note pen".
It will then let you type in a note.  When you are finished, you can then
summon a mail daemon by typing "mail note Name", where name is the person you
want to send it to.  The note will be delivered as soon as the person logs on
again, or, if they are already on, instantaneously (them daemons are fast :)

Mail Rules:

  1) Junk mail, abusive mail, and mass mail is strictly prohibited
  2) If anyone sends the above, keep the mail, and report it... the
     mail is your only proof..
  3) Violators will be:
       Fined on first offense
       Deleted on second offense
       Have site blocked on third offense
#
"CHAOS NIGHT" ARENA

Every so often (pretty much at an immortals whim), an arena is run.  What this
means is that the immortal running it picks what levels he wants to participate,
and how much it will cost to get in, etc, and then the mortals are allowed to
kill each other, for a cash prize.  When an arena is started, a message will
be sent to all players telling them how to join, etc.

           ----- You loose absolutely noting in the arena. -----
When you enter, you will be fully healed, and when you are dead, you will
be healed and whisked back to the fountain.  Your equipment will not
be damaged, however, if you use limited use items (potions, scrolls, wands,
etc), they will be used permanently.  This will be fixed eventually though.

To be notified of what is going on in the arena type CHANNEL SPORTS, typing it
again will turn it off.

Asking for an arena to be run is a criminal offense, and you will be fined for
doing so.
#
HITALL

This skill allows you to hit everyone in a room.

If you type hitall all, it will attack everything in a room.
#
MAP MAPS

The map command will let you see a 5x5 grid around your area if you are
in Midgard.  There are maps of the city available on the board south
of the fountain, and there are map stones all over the place.
#
ASSASSINATE ASSASINATE ASSASINATION

To assassinate someone, you must be an assassin, and you must successfully
backstab them.  At that point, the game will make a check against your
assassinate skill (which goes up every 5 levels), to see if you got
lucky.  A level difference is calculated in, so that it is impossible for
a low level character to assassinate something well above him.
#
SHOPDOC

keeper
shopkeeper       Either one is acceptable... This is the vnum of the mobile
		 that is the shopkeeper.  This is required.

		 EX: keeper { 3020 }

location         Room number where this shop is located.
		 Eventually, if this is 0 (ommited), the mob listed as keeper
		 will be a travelling salesman.

		 EX: location { 3856 }

buy_type         The types of items that this shop will buy.  This is optional
		 and any number may be listed.  If nothing is listed under
		 this, and nothing is listed under buy, this shop won't buy

		  EX: buy_type { armor, weapon, key }
		  Note: This shop will only buy keys that are of type key...
		  Many keys are of type trash...

buy               This is a explicit list of items that this shop will buy
		  This is in addition to any it will buy because of buy_type

		  EX: buy { 1000, 1001, 1002 }

sell              This is the list of items that this shop will produce and
		  sell in unlimited quantities.

		  EX: sell { 100, 1002, 3004 }
		  Note that a shopkeeper will sell anything that he is holding,
                  so that he will sell anything he buys.

sell_mult         This is the markup for selling.  Should be >= 1.0
		  The selling price is computed as sell_mult*real_cost

		  This shop gives the player half of what something is worth.

		  times as needed to produce some weird hours.

		      hours { 7, 12}

		      Open from 0-3 and 7-12

	  dont_have { Message if store doesn't have }
	  no_item { Message if player doesn't have item he is trying to sell }

	  player_cant_afford { Message if player can't afford item }
	  buy { Message when item is bought by shop... %d is price }
	  sell { Message when item is sold by shop... %d is price }
	}

#
SHOW

The show command is quite versatile.  The possible uses are:

  show zones
      Shows all of the zones in the game, their lifespan and age,
      (sometimes) who they 'belong' to, what range of rooms they include,
      and how often they reset.

  show (objects|mobiles) (zone#|name)
      Shows all of the mobs or objects within a zone, or all the mobs or
      objects that have <name> in their namelist.
  show rooms (zone#|death|private)
      Lists all of the rooms in a zone, all of the death rooms (DTs)
      currently in the world, or all of the private rooms currently in the
      world.

  show exits (zone)
      Same as above, but lists all of the exits instead of the rooms.
#
DEFAULTSPELL

How spells using this formula work:

Spells do #d# * (your level+1 - spell learn lvl)  damage.

Example: magic missile learnable at lvl 3 does: 1d4*1  if your lvl 3
 at lvl 4 it does 1d4*2 at 5,  1d4*3 and so on the highest multiplier
 on most spells is 20.  So the highest magic missile can get is 1d4*20

now for another example: say you just learned mage fire (lvl 125) it does:
5d9*1 you gain a level and it does 5d9*2  gain another 5d9*3  and so on up to 20

#
PORTAL
Components  :  a mithril hammer  and ???

Create a portal anyone can enter to a person
duration is level / 100 ticks

usage: cast 'portal' name

BEWARE: portals can lead to NASTY places you should probably look portal
first if you dont know where it goes. Newbies probably should not enter
portals.

#
RUNNINGLOG

The runninglog command toggles the log messages which normally appear on 
the screen. These messages include errors in the game, new characters
starting up, old characters logging in, characters logging out, and other
such details which can affect the game.
 
#
PWHERE

Pwhere allows an immortal to see where visible players are at that point
in the game. The format is: Pwhere [character's name]. This will give the
room number and room name where the player is currently located. The command
will also show where a visible immortal is.

#
SNOWBALL

Snowball is a harmless command, much like slap, whose use is limited to
immortals. The form is: snow(ball) [character's name], and the message
shown is: You conjure a snowball from the thin air and throw it at [char
name].

#
MWHERE

The mwhere command is much like the pwhere command, except that it shows
the locations of monsters instead of players in the game. The format is
also the same: mwhere [name].

#
OFFSET

Offset is a builder's aid command. If you are editing an area say in the
range of 250001 to 250099, then by typing: offset 250000 the range will
become 1 to 99. Basically it will add the offset value to any goto's or
at commands you use. To reset to no offest, use: offset 0.

#
RESCUE

A rescue is an attempt to put yourself between a monster and the character
who is currently fighting it. This means that, if successful, the monster
will now attack you. Only one person may be rescued per round. This is a
very useful command when playing in groups.

#
WORLD

The world command shows the most recent start-up time, current time at 
the source location, # of rooms in the world, # of zones in the world, 
facts and figures on mobs and objs, and the # of registered players.

#
SKILLS

The skills command will show all of the skills and the levels at which
they are gained. The format is: skills [class]. If you wish to see your 
own skills, no class needs to be entered. See also the SPELLS command.

#
SPELLS

The spells command will show all of the spells and the levels at which they
are gained. The format is: spells [class]. If you wish to see your own spells
list, no class needs to be entered. See also the SKILLS command.

For the old spells damage list see SPELL_INFO.

#
CHANGES
 
New class names:
W/T=Highwayman ------T/W=Rogue
M/T=Powermonger -----T/M=Scout
C/W=Templar ---------W/C=Expositor
M/C=Necromancer -----C/M=Scholar
R/D=Forester --------D/R=Herbalist
M/W=Warlock ---------W/M=Warlord
M/T/W=Overlord ----- M/W/T=Sohei
T/W/M=Brigand -------T/M/W=Dragoon
W/T/M=Mercenary -----W/M/T=Warder
W/D=Celtic ----------D/W=Woodsman
 
NOTE: PURE CLASSES get skills FASTER cheaper and BETTER
The FIRST class of a PC gets things better and FASTER
the SECOND gets SLOWER than FIRST class and NOT AS GOOD
the THIRD gets SLOWER than SECOND class and NOT AS GOOD
 
You now get between 50 and ~300 practices per level each practice is sort of
like a percentage point.
 
Spells now have DIFFICULTY levels SECOND AND THIRD "classes"  skills and
spells are more difficult to learn
 
A DIFFICULTY level of 1 means it takes 100 practices to get to 100% (assuming
you can get 100%). A DIFFICULTY level of 2 means it takes 200 and so on.
 
SOME spells and skills now COST CASH to learn.
Cost is figured: cost*diff*100
IE a cost 10 diff 1 would cost: 10*1*100 or 1000 coins.
 
You can PRACTICE # SKILL (or spell). IE prac 100 bash (is 100 bash sessions)
 
Check the Skill and Spell commands allspell doesnt exist anymore.
 
*IF YOU DIE YOU WILL LOSE LEVELS NOW! (and hps) exp lose has been lessened
to a max of 500k per 30 levels OR 1/4th exp if you have less than 500k*

Some spells take COMPONENTS now some of these will be in the help others you
must find on your own. There are only 2 right now many more will be added later
you need a bandaid for aid (for a few classes) and poison ivy for poison.
