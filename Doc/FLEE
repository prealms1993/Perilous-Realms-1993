COMMAND FLEE

General Description:
  Attempt to flee from your attacker in the quickest way possible.

Chance of Success:
  6 attemps are made at fleeing for each invocation of this commmand... each
  of the 6 attempts is in a random direction.  The flee succeeds if you
  successfully can walk in the direction it sent you.

Result of Success:
  You escape whoever you were fighting.
  If you are over 3rd level, you loos 1/10 of the monsters experience
  if you are over half of your hitpoints, or 1/25 of the monthers experience
  if you are over 1/20 of your hitpoints... If you are less than 1/20, you
  loos 1/100 of the experience of the opponent.
  No matter what, you can not loose more than 100K xp, or 1/100 your xp.

  If the person doing the fleeing is a monster, then whoever they fleed from
  is added to their list of "feared" people.

  If the person fleeing is a character, the following is used to determine
  whether or not a mobile will start hunting you:
    percent = 100 * monsters_hp / max_hp
    if random(1,101) > percent then if one of the following holds, the monster
    will start hunting you
	1) The monster hates you.
	2) You are good and the monster is evil
	3) You are evil and the monster is good
	

Results of Failure:
  You don't escape.

Restrictions:
  In the ARENA, you do not loose experience points.
  If you are not fighting anyone, you do not loose experience.
  You can not flee into a death trap.
