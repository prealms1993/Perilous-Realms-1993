 
As many of you may know Perilous Realms is trying to move to its own player
owned machine. What this would mean is no more bouncing around from machine
to machine (well we have only bounced once so far) no more limits on the
number of players at one time (except the machines limit) and no more sharing
the machine with other processes like news that would slow it down for the
game. So over the past week I have gone out and priced several machines and
as promised I am now posting those prices and what I hope to see happen..
 
DEC Alpha ............ 15k
HP 9000/715 .......... 13k
Sun3 ................. 12k
IBM 486/66 ............ 8k
 
These are all with a 1G drive and 64megs of memory (and for the ibm its all
SCSI hardware). The IBM also includes ~$1000 for the UNIX OS (which may or
may not cover it as an OS hasnt been decided on yet and some are quite a bit
over 1k).

By request a list of approx prices for the pc: 1G drive $1300, 64megs of error
correcting memory $3500+, Busmaster VLB card with 2 meg $600+, CPU $600, MB $300
Misc other items (case, drives, net card, mono VGA monitor and card), Operating
system $1000
 
Because of the prices and the fact that the hardware is not proprietary (so
fixing any problems wont cost lots of money) I want to go with the IBM machine.
 
Now here is the kicker. I cant pay 8k for a machine to run P.R. on, with my job
there is no way I could do that. What I am going to do is look towards you the
players of P.R. and ask for a small donation from each of you. Depending on
the amount of your donation I will be offering ingame rewards to your PC. Also
each player who donates at least $5 will be transferred to the new machine once
it is up and running. Each donator will also have their name and amount donated
listed in a new command (founders?). If we can actually get enough for the
machine I will also be able to leave P.R. v1 running after v2 is done, presently
v1 is planned to most likely go down soon after v2 starts running because I
wont have room to run both at once. V1 also has almost no work going on on it
and no new areas planned for it, if we get this machine I will start fixing up
the broken areas and adding the new ones I have around here (and some fix it
up work will be done on the code). Other things like my policy on reimbursement
would also be a bit more lenient (although multiplaying is still a no no). I
will also fix up the armor class system so it actually works right/means
something again.
 
It is entirely possibly that v1 will stay here on crl.com while v2 goes to
another machine but if this happens the 20 player limit will still be here
and I wont be doing much more advancement of the server (except for bug
fixes). In other words what you see now is what you'll get. If the possible
site for v2 falls through then we are talking a whole new deal once v2 is
ready. *A COPY OF PR V? WILL STAY HERE ON CRL!*

+16 ring or whatever (also not 1 plus 7 ring). You can get a +4 and +3 ring
but not both + the same thing either!

The highest donator will get a "special bonus" if over $100 an even better
bonus.
 
The levels and items are for v1. v2 has no levels. I may include something on 
the v2 mud as well if you are interested in it.

All Items will be usable by any class. They will also be exempt from the
adjustments that may happen to items in the next 6-8 months (time permitting).
This will follow the fixing of the AC system.
 
All donations can be sent to:
  P.R. Fund (c/o Craig Mohr)
  1034 NW 34th
  Corvallis, Oregon USA
                  97330
 
Make checks or Money orders payable to "Craig Mohr". (Bank didnt like PR Fund)
Please include your PC's name with your donation. I am trying to set up a 
special account under the name P.R. Fund but the bank is being hard nosed 
and saying they can only do it for non-profit corporations which we are not
since we are trying to get money for a machine to run this on. That is why
I need my name on the pay to line in the future I hope to just have P.R. Fund.
(It actually IS in another account seperate from anything of mine just not
under the name I wanted..)

The money will stay in the account collecting interest until there is enough to
pay for the machine, OS and connection. I am currently talking to the school
here about getting a free connection but wont know for awhile. There IS the
possibility of NOT getting enough cash for the machine. If this does happen
I cant repay everyone. It might instead go towards getting a better account
on another machine that requires payment or possibly buying a harddrive for
someone elses machine and then using that space. This is one reason for the
items and levels since there is no guarranty the other is for incentive.

PR has been around for over 2 years now and I hope we can be around for many
many more to come.

Deth has made the first $100 contribution.
